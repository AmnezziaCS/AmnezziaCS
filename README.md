## My projects

Apart from school studies, I try to develop stuff on my own because i think it's the best way to learn while having fun.

### ‚ú® [Chocobot](https://github.com/amnezziaa/ChocoBot)

Chocobot is a currency and [osu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12765882/osu) related Discord bot fully developed in `NodeJS`.

## Currently working on

### üêç [SnakeExtension](https://github.com/amnezziaa/SnakeExtension)

The idea of this project is to create a Google Chrome extension that makes it easier for [speedrunners](https://www.speedrun.com/snake_game) to keep up with their session.

### ‚öíÔ∏è Global refactor of my repos

I like perfection. Therefore, when one of the things I created starts to get old, I like to come back on it and make it better using all the knowledge I acquired in the meantime.
